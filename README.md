# Swift-Notes

This is a collection of notes taken from my Swift learnings.

It consists of notes from the Udemy [IOS 10 & Swift
3](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios10/learn/v4/overview) course and from the
[Swift
Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/). The playground files cover each topic with examples and comments.
